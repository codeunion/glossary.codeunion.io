OAuth is a [protocol](/protocol) built on top of
[http](/http-hypertext-transfer-protocol) to allow [client
applications](/client-server-model) to access a users data without needing to
store their password. You will use the [authorization
header](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#auth_header) to provide the twitter
[web-service](/web-service-or-web-api) with the appropriate [user context](/authorization).
