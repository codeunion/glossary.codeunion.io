A web [API](/api) is a program hosted on on a [web](/web) [server](/server) designed to be used by other programs.

For example, using Yelp's API you could write a lunch decider app that interacts with their [search API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api) and selects a single location based upon whatever criteria you like.

While a web API is often used interchangeably with the term "[web service](/web-service)", use of the term "web API" usually implies that the interface follows [RESTful](/rest) conventions. A "web service" is a more generic term for any web-hosted software that is designed to communicate with other software (machine-to-machine communication).
