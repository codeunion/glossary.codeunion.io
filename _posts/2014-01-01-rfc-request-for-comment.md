RFCs are public documents outlining a standard in the technology industry. While exhaustive and academic, they provide all the information necessary to implement a standard. They are often used for reference.

[RFC 2616](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html) exhaustively documents how to implement [HTTP](/http-hypertext-transfer-protocol). Don't worry, it's only 147 pages!

A more readable one is [RFC4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt)
which specifies how to format CSV files in a mere 7 pages.

Not all RFC's are computer focused, [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) is an RFC for people who write RFCs!
