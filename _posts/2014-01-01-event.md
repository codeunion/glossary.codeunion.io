Programs can send and receive messages to each other. One way to work with this
functionality is to implement the notion of **events**. With events, you can
write code that says "when this happens, run this function".

The larger paradigm of writing code that sends and receives events is called
[event-driven
programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming), and is
closely related to other [messaging
patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_pattern) like the
[publish-subscribe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern)
pattern.

In this article, we will cover the concept of events using the language of
**subscribing** and **publishing**, which can be thought of as roughly
equivalent to _event handlers_ and _event firing_, respectively.

_Why would you want to use an evented model?_

Say you have one program that manages news stories, and another program that
reads these bulletins. When a new story comes in, you want the reading program
to be notified immediately.

In other words, you want one program to _publish_ stories, and the other program
to _subscribe_ to the first. That way, you can satisfy the use case of "when a
new story is published, it should appear on the news reader".

Below is an implementation of the publish subscribe pattern:

(in Ruby)

```ruby
$subscriptions = [] # a store for subscriptions

# create a new subscription for a certain of event
def subscribe(event_type, &callback)
  $subscriptions.push({ :event => event_type, :callback => callback })
end

# distribute event data to all subscriptions for
# the given kind of event
def publish(event_type, event_data = "")
  $subscriptions.each do |subscription|
    if subscription[:event] == event_type
      subscription[:callback].call(event_data)
    end
  end
end

publish(:news)
# Huh, doesn't do much

subscribe(:news) { puts "New story received." }

publish(:news, "President declares national holiday")
# => New story received

subscribe(:news) do |story|
  puts "This just in: #{story}"
end

publish(:news, "Gophers are psychic!")
# => New story received.
# => This just in: Gophers are psychic!

publish(:gossip, "Pope dances tango with Richard Dawkins")
# Hmm, nobody seems to be listening
```

(in JavaScript)

```javascript
var subscriptions = []; // a store for subscriptions

// Create a new subscription for a certain of event
function subscribe(eventType, callback) {
  subscriptions.push({ event: eventType, callback: callback });
}

// Distribute event data to all subscriptions for
// the given kind of event.
function publish(eventType, eventData) {
  eventData = eventData || "";
  subscriptions.forEach(function(subscription) {
    if (subscription.event == eventType) {
      subscription.callback(eventData);
    }
  });
}

publish("news");
// Huh, doesn't do much

subscribe("news", function() {
  console.log("New story received.");
});

publish("news", "President declares national holiday");
// => New story received

subscribe("news", function(story) {
  console.log("This just in: " + story);
});

publish("news", "Gophers are psychic!");
// => New story received.
// => This just in: Gophers are psychic!

publish("gossip", "Pope dances tango with Richard Dawkins");
// Hmm, nobody seems to be listening
```
