A Key/Value pair is a way to connect [data](/data) with human friendly names. Often key-value pairs are held within a container. Key value pairs are used everywhere in programming.

* `first_name = "Zee"` - Defines a ruby variable named `first_name` with the value `"Zee"`. The key in this case is `first_name`.
* `{ :first_name => "Zee", :last_name => "Spencer" }` - Defines a ruby [hash](/hash-map-datatype) which contains two key value pairs: key `:first_name` with value "Zee"  and key `:lastname` with value "Spencer".
* `<a href="http://google.com">Search!</a>` - Defines an HTML link which contains a key `href` with the value `"http://google.com"`.
