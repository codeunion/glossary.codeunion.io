Data is pieces of [information](/information) stored in or represented by a
computer. Data has different [types](/data-types), and is frequently used by
[programs](/computer-program) to do work.

Consider the following code:

(In Ruby)

``` ruby
coding_school = {
  :name => "CodeUnion",
  :courses_offered => [:web_fundamentals_in_ruby,
                       :pro_engineering_with_rails,
                       :topics_in_cs],
  :years_in_operation => 1
}
```

(in JavaScript)

```javascript
coding_school = {
  "name": "CodeUnion",
  "courses_offered": ["web_fundamentals_in_ruby",
                      "pro_engineering_with_rails",
                      "topics_in_cs"],
  "years_in_operation": 1
}
```

This data represents CodeUnion yet is not CodeUnion itself and does nothing on
its own. Data requires a [program](/computer-program) or a person to interpret
it and do work.

Different kinds of data are represented with different [data
types](/data-types). This data set demonstrates four common [data
types](/data-types):

* [Dictionaries](/dictionary-data-type)
* [Strings](/string-data-type)
* [Arrays (or Lists)](/array-data-type)
* [Numbers](/number-data-types)


A reasonable mental model is to think of data and [information](/information)
like kinetic and potential energy. Data is potential energy, waiting for the
right program or person to make use of it. Information is kinetic energy, data
put in motion to do work.
