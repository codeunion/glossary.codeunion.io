An Access Token Secret, sometimes called a "User Secret", is created when a user
logs into an application using [OAuth](/OAuth). Access Token Secrets are unique
on a per-user-per-application basis. You should never share a users Access Token
Secret, as they are the "password" of OAuth's [Authentication](/authentication).
