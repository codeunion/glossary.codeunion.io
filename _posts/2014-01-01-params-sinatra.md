Sinatra provides a hash of data from an [HTTP request](/http-request) in a helper method named `params`.

`Params`  gets its [key-value pairs](/keyvalue-pair) from [forms](/form-html), url [named parameters](http://ruby.about.com/od/sinatra/ss/sinatra3_4.htm), or url [query variables](/query-variable)
