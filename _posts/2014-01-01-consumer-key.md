A Consumer Key, sometimes called an API Key, is used to
identify your application when sending
[requests](/request) to a [web service](/web-service-or-web-api) that uses
[OAuth](/oauth). Consumer keys are generated when you register your application
with the web api. Consumer Keys may be shared publicly; as they are analogous to
a username when using OAuth for [authentication](/authentication).
