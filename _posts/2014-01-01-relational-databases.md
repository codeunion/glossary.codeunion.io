Relational databases are built on the premise that data is useful primarily in how it relates to other data. A "reasonable" mental model for relational databases are like a spreadsheet. They have [tables](/table-databases); which have [columns](/columns-databases) that describe the kind of data in the table, and [rows](/rows-databases) for each data entry. The relationship between tables is preserved with [keys](/keys-databases) that reference other tables.
