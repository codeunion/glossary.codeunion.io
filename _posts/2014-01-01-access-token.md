An Access Token, sometimes called a "User Token", is created when a user logs into an application using [OAuth](/OAuth).

It is unique on a per-user-per-application basis. An Access Token can be shared publicly without risk. Think of them as the "username" for OAuth's
[Authentication](/authentication).
