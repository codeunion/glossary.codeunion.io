Encoding is the process of turning [data](/data) from one form to another.
I've encoded an important message: "Ogrammingpray isay awesomeay." Your brain
has probably "decoded" this message into "Programming is awesome." Encoding
allows you to put data into a [format](/data-formats) that other programs can read.
