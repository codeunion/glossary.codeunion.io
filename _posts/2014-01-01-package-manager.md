A package manager is used to install [applications](/application),
[libraries](/library), and [frameworks](/framework) onto a computer. There are
two kinds of package managers: [system package
managers](#system-package-managers) and [language package
managers](#language-package-managers).

## System Package Managers
System package managers are like an App store for programmers. They install
software on a computer along with the software's [dependencies](/dependency).
Below are some system package managers and their operating systems:

 * [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (OS X) - Common in developer circles. Lacks
   ability to lock to a version.
 * [Macports](https://www.macports.org) (OS X) - Older than Brew. Allows locking
   a package to a version.
 * [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org) (OS X) - Older than Brew. Allows locking a
   package to a version.
 * [Yum](http://yum.baseurl.org) (Linux) - Used on servers based off of the Red
   Hat Linux distribution
 * [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) (Linux) - Used on servers and desktop
   machines based off of the Debian Linux distribution, Such as Ubuntu.

## Language Package Managers
Language package managers install [libraries](/library),
[frameworks](/framework), and programs for a specific [programming
language](/programming-language). Language package managers are limited in that
they cannot install system dependencies, which is why when you install a
database library you must install the database program to your system
independently.

Below is a list of language package managers and their language:

* [Gem](/gem) - Ruby
* [Bower](http://bower.io) - JavaScript (Front-end)
* [Ender](https://github.com/ender-js/Ender) - JavaScript (Front-end)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) - JavaScript (Back-end)
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/) - Python
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) - Java
* [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) - Haskell
