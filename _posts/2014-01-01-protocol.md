Protocols define how computers communicate. There is a wide ecosystem of
protocols, each with different purposes. They are often specified using a
[Request for Comment](/rfc-request-for-comment). There are many kinds of
protocols with different purposes. SMTP, POP and IMAP are all for email;
[HTTP](/http-hypertext-transfer-protocol) is for web pages; Jabber (or XMPP) is
for chat, and many many more. Don't worry about learning the protocols details
at the moment.
