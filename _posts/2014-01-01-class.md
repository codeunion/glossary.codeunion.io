A class is a definition of a data type. It tells you what methods you can call on a variables. If you look at [the rubydoc of the `String` class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/String.html) you'll see a list of methods on the left hand side of the page. The methods that you can call on variables which are a `String` are prefixed with `#`. These are called "instance variables".
