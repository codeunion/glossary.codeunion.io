A gem is useful Ruby code packaged up for you to use. They allow us to be more productive by providing solutions for common use cases.

Ruby gems are installed with the `gem` command, or using [bundler](/gemfile#bundler)

Ruby applications use a [Gemfile](/gemfile) to declare their dependencies (which gems are required to run the application.) Ruby [libraries](/library) declare their gem dependencies in the a [gemspec](http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/)

[Writing your own gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/) is a great way to learn how to write re-usable software as well as contributing back to the Ruby community.
