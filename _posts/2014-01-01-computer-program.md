A computer program is a set of instructions provided to and executed by a
computer. Computer programs are written in a
[programming-language](/programming-language) by a [computer
programmer](/computer-programmer).

Most computer programs are intended to
[transform](/algorithm-data-transformation) [data](/data) from an unused form to
a useful form, known as [information](/information).

All computer programs follow a common pattern:
* The program is given [input](/input) [data](/data)
* It [transforms data with algorithm(s)](/algorithm-data-transformation)
* It provides the results as [output](/output)

Graphical programs follow this pattern within an [event loop](/event-loop).
They take touch, keyboard or mouse [events](/event-programming) as input and
draw on the screen for output.

Web programs follow this pattern within the [request/response
cycle](/request-response-cycle). They take an [http request](/request-http) as
input and provide an [http response](/response-http) as output.
