A framework is a collection of code used to solve a set of related use cases.
Most frameworks focus on developer productivity at the expense of precise
control.

Good frameworks:

* Are well documented
* Solve several closely related use cases.
* Are actively maintained
* Are extensible
* Don't change their [interface](/interface) often.

When deciding between using a framework or a library, ask:

* How much control do we have to give up? Is that OK for our current context?
* Which parts of the framework will we be using? A small sliver or most of it?
* How large of a surface area does the framework have?
* How much will we need to learn to be effective?

Some popular frameworks are:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) - A server side web application
  framework for interacting with [databases](/database) and building web pages.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - A front-end framework for manipulating web pages
  and interacting with web [APIs](/api-application-programming-interface)

Frameworks are installed with a languages [package
manager](/package-manager#language-package-managers) such as [gem](/gem), the
Ruby package manager.
