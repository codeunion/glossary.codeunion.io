title: Absolute Path

In the context of an OS (\*nix, Windows), an absolute (or full) path is one that points to the same location on the file system regardless of the present working directory, e.g. `/Users/sandra/Documents/homework.txt`.

In the context of the web, an absolute path is synonymous with the [URL](/url). At the least, it includes the _protocol_, _domain_, and a _path_ to a file or resource, for example: `http://www.sandra.me/homework/history.html`. In this example, `http` is the protocol, `www.sandra.me` is the host, and `/homework/history.html` is the path.
