Information is when data is put to work. The arrival and departure times at all
the bus stops is [data](/data). Using them to travel across the city is
information.

Most [computer programs](/computer-program) are designed to take [data](/data)
and provide information.

A reasonable mental model is to think of data and information like kinetic and
potential energy. Data is potential energy, waiting for the right program or
person to make use of it. Information is kinetic energy, data put in motion to
do work.
