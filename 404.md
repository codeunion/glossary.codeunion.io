**Whoops, looks like there isn't a page there.**

Did you expect to find a glossary entry here? It may be missing because it isn't written yet!

If that's the case, you may want to review the [issues](https://github.com/codeunion/glossary.codeunion.io/issues) for this repository to see if the entry has been requested and/or is under development. Feel free to request a glossary entry by adding an issue yourself.

For example, you could add an issue titled `Regular expression` and supply any helpful guiding instructions for what you'd like the entry to cover, such as:

> Please include description of special characters, groups, and flags.
