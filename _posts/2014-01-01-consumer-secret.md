A Consumer secret, sometimes called an API Secret, is used to
identify your application when sending
[requests](/request) to a [web service](/web-service-or-web-api) that uses
[OAuth](/oauth). Consumer secrets are generated when you register your application
with the web api. You should not share consumer secrets publicly; as they are analogous to
a password when using OAuth for [authentication](/authentication).
