A Consumer Key, sometimes called an API Key, is used to identify your application when sending [requests](/http-request) to a [web service](/web-service) that uses [OAuth](/oauth).

Consumer keys are generated when you register your application with the web api. Consumer Keys may be shared publicly; as they are analogous to a username when using OAuth for [authentication](/authentication).
