An API is a way to expose parts of a program so other programs may use it.

APIs can be built on the [Web](/web) as [Web Services](/web-service) or they can be programs running on your computer.

An example of an API for a program are browser plugins. Plugins such as [Hey Girl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hey-girl/jcpmmhaffdebnmkjelaohgjmndeongip) and [Mustachio Redux](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mustachio-redux/hbnnipmnpgiepegnlmekieblhjmchmbf) use the browsers api to change pictures as you browse the web.
