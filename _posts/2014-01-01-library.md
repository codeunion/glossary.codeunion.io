A library is a collection of code to solve a particular use case. Most libraries
provide more precise control than a [framework](/framework) but less precise
control than writing an implementation yourself.

Good libraries:

* Are well documented
* Solve a single use case
* Are actively maintained
* Don't change their [interface](/interface) often.

When deciding between using a library or writing your own implementation, ask:

* Is this a common use case for many programs, such as user authentication or
  connecting to a database?
* Does the use case require significant expertise or have high risk, such as
  encryption?
* How difficult is the problem to solve well? A few lines? or a few hundred?

A library that solves more than one use case is considered a
[framework](/framework). Libraries are installed with their [languages package
manager](/package-manager#language-packe-managers) such as [gem](/gem),  the
Ruby package manager.
