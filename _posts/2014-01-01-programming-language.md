A programming language bridges the gap between [machine code](/machine-code)
and human language. It's a tool for humans to provide
[instructions](/instruction) a computer can understand.

Because computers are pedantic and do not handle ambiguity well programming
languages have rules for how to structure code, called [syntax](/syntax). When
these rules are broken, the programming language will provide a [syntax
error](/syntax#syntax-error).

Some programming languages, like Ruby, try to avoid forcing people to conform
to the machine's pedanticism. While this seems like a good idea (Yay! Fewer
parenthesis!) it may result in ambiguous code which looks valid but is not.

Programming languages are often grouped based on whether they:
* Must be [compiled](/compiler) before being run, or whether they may be
  [interpretted](/interpreter) on the fly
* Validate data [conforms to a declared type](/strong-typing) or if they allow
  [types to be modified at runtime](/weak-typing).

Most interpreted programming languages have two ways to interact with them. You may:

* Write code into a file and run the file with the language's
  [interpreter](/interpreter).
* Start an [interactive session](/interactive-repl) and type commands line
  by line.
