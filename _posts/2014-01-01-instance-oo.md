An `instance` is used to describe a variable or value created from a [class](/class). Instances may use any [instance methods](/instance-method) or [instance variables](/instance-variable) their class provided. Here the variable `so_many_his` is an instance of the `Array` class:
```
so_many_his = Array.new(10, "hi!")
puts so_many_his.class
```
