There are four main "verbs" used in [web services](/web-service):

* GET - Retrieves data from the service
* POST - Adds data to the service
* PUT - Replaces data in the service
* DELETE - Removes data from the service

Every [HTTP Request](/http-request) uses one of these verbs in conjunction with a [URL](/url) to change [data](/data) in the web service.
