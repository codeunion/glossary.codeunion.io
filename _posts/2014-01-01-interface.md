An interface is how we interact with code.

Interfaces are defined by three things:

1. A clear, concise, descriptive name
2. The input [data](/data) or [arguments](/function-argument)
3. The output [data](/data) or [return value](/return-value)

It is important to test and document our interfaces. This provides future-us and
our collaborators with a better understanding of how to use the code.
