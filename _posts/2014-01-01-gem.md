A gem is useful Ruby code packaged up for you to use. They
allow us to be more productive by providing solutions for
common use cases.

Ruby gems are installed with the `gem` command, or using
[bundler](/gemfile#bundler)

Ruby applications use a [Gemfile](/gemfile) to declare their
dependencies (which gems are required to run the
application.) Ruby [libraries](/library) declare their gem
dependencies in the a
[gemspec](http://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/)

[Writing your own
gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/) is a
great way to learn how to write re-usable software as well
as contributing back to the Ruby community.
