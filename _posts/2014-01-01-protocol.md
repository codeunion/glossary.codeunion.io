Protocols define how computers communicate. There is a wide ecosystem of protocols, each with different purposes.

They are often specified using a [Request for Comment](/rfc). There are many kinds of protocols with different purposes. SMTP, POP and IMAP are all for email; [HTTP](/http) is for web pages; Jabber (or XMPP) is for chat, and many many more. Don't worry about learning the protocols details at the moment.
