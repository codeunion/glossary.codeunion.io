There are four main "verbs" used in [web services](/web-services-or-web-apis):
* GET - Retrieves data from the service
* POST - Adds data to the service
* PUT - Replaces data in the service
* DELETE - Removes data from the service

Every [HTTP Request](/request) uses one of these verbs in conjunction with
a [URL](/url-uniform-resource-locator) to change [data](/data) in the web
service.
