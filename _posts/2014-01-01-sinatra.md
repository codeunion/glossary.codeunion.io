Sinatra is a [web application](/web-application) [framework](/application-framework) that makes it easy to [respond](/http-response) to [http](/http-hypertext-transfer-protocol) [requests](/http-request) in ruby.

It is much smaller than Rails; and doesn't hide as many details about what's going on as rails does. This makes it an ideal learning tool for understanding the web.
