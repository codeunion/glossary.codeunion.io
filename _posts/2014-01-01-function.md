A function is a way to store a set of instructions for re-use in a [computer
program](/computer-program). Functions are [passed arguments](/argument) as
[input](/input) and provide a [return value](/return-value) as
[output](/output).

A function which only interacts with it's arguments and no other data is known
as a _pure function_. Functions which rely on other data are known as
[methods](/method).

Pure functions tend to be easier to understand, as they do not change their
[behavior](/behavior) based upon the [state](/state) of the system.

Because methods rely on outside variables to do their work, if those variables
change the methods behavior may change at [runtime](/runtime).

Some examples:

(in Ruby)

```ruby
# This is a pure function. It is completely self contained.
# It takes an argument named "number", multiplies the number by two and returns
# the result
def double(number)
  number * 2
end


@multiplication_amount = 10

# This is a method. It reaches outside of itself for the value stored in
# @multiplication_amount to do it's work.
def configurable_multiplier(number)
  number * @multiplication_amount
end

puts configurable_multiplier(5) == 50
@multiplication_amount = 5
puts configurable_multiplier(5) == 25
# See how changing a variable changes the output of the method despite the
# input being the same?
```

(In JavaScript)

```javascript
// This is a pure function. It is completely self contained.
// It takes an argument named "number", multiplies the number by 2, and returns
// the result.
var double = function(number) {
  return double * 2;
};


var multiplicationAmount = 10;

// This is a method. It reaches outside of itself for the value stored in
// multiplicationAmount to do it's work.
var configurableMultiplier = function(number) {
  return multiplicationAmount * number;
}

console.log(configurableMultiplier(5) == 50);
multiplicationAmount = 5;
console.log(configurableMultiplier(3) == 15);
```
