An interface are the names, inputs, and outputs of a piece of code. They are the
knobs and handles we use to interact with the code.

Interfaces are defined by three things:

1. A clear, concise, descriptive name
2. The input [data](/data) or [arguments](/function-argument)
3. The output [data](/data) or [return value](/return-value)

When building applications, we organize our code with [functions](/function) and
organize our functions into [modules](/module) or [classes](/class). The
interface of a module or class are it's functions along with those functions
arguments and return values.

It is important to test and document our interfaces. This provides us and our
collaborators with a better understanding of how to use the code.
